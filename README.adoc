= Spring Data JDBC

The primary goal of the http://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data] project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies. *Spring Data JDBC* offers the popular Repository abstraction based on JDBC

== This is NOT an ORM

Spring Data JDBC does not try to be an ORM. It is not a competitor to JPA. Instead it is more of a construction kit for your personal ORM that you can define the way you like or need it.

This means that it does rather little out of the box. But it offers plenty of places where you can put your own logic, or integrate it with the technology of your choice for generating SQL statements.

== Features

=== CRUD operations

=== Events

== Getting Help

== Quick Start

== Execute Tests

=== Fast running tests

Fast running tests can executed with a simple 

[source]
----
mvn test
----

This will execute unit tests and integration tests using an in-memory database.

=== Running tests with a real database

To run the integration tests against a specific database you nned to have the database running on your local machine and then execute.

[source]
----
mvn test -Dspring.profiles.active=<databasetype>
----

This will also execute the unit tests.

Currently the following _databasetypes_ are available:

* hsql (default, does not need to be running)
* mysql

=== Run tests with all databases

[source]
----
mvn test -Pall-dbs
----

This will execute the unit tests, and all the integration tests with all the databases we currently support for testing. The databases must be running.
