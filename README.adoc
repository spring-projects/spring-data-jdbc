= Spring Data Relational

The primary goal of the https://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data] project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies. *Spring Data Relational* offers the popular Repository abstraction based on link:spring-data-jdbc[JDBC].

It aims at being conceptually easy.
In order to achieve this it does NOT offer caching, lazy loading, write behind or many other features of JPA.
This makes Spring Data JDBC a simple, limited, opinionated ORM.

== Features

* Implementation of CRUD methods for Aggregates.
* `@Query` annotation
* Support for transparent auditing (created, last changed)
* Events for persistence events
* Possibility to integrate custom repository code
* JavaConfig based repository configuration by introducing `EnableJdbcRepository`
* Integration with MyBatis

== Maven Coordinates

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-data-jdbc</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

== Modules

Spring Data Relational ships with multiple modules:

* Spring Data Relational: Common infrastructure abstracting general aspects of relational database access.
* link:spring-data-jdbc[Spring Data JDBC]: Repository support for JDBC-based datasources.

== Getting Help

If you are new to Spring Data JDBC read the following two articles https://spring.io/blog/2018/09/17/introducing-spring-data-jdbc["Introducing Spring Data JDBC"] and https://spring.io/blog/2018/09/24/spring-data-jdbc-references-and-aggregates["Spring Data JDBC, References, and Aggregates"]

There are also examples in the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-examples/tree/master/jdbc[Spring Data Examples] project.

A very good source of information is the source code in this repository.
Especially the integration tests (if you are reading this on github, type `t` and then `IntegrationTests.java`)

We are keeping an eye on the (soon to be created) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-data-jdbc[spring-data-jdbc tag on stackoverflow].

If you think you found a bug, or have a feature request please https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAJDBC/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel[create a ticket in our issue tracker].

== Building from Source

You don't need to build from source to use Spring Data Relational (binaries in https://repo.spring.io[repo.spring.io]).
If you want to try out the latest and greatest, Spring Data Relational can be easily built with Maven.
You also need JDK 1.8.

[source]
----
$ mvn clean install
----

=== Fast running tests

Fast running tests can be executed with a simple

[source]
----
$ mvn test
----

This will execute unit tests and integration tests using an in-memory database.

=== Running tests with a real database

In order to run the integration tests against a specific database you need to have a local Docker installation available, and then execute.

[source]
----
$ mvn test -Dspring.profiles.active=<databasetype>
----

This will also execute the unit tests.

Currently the following _databasetypes_ are available:

* hsql (default, does not require a running database)
* mysql
* postgres
* mariadb
* mssql

=== Run tests with all databases

[source]
----
$ mvn test -Pall-dbs
----

This will execute the unit tests, and all the integration tests with all the databases we currently support for testing. Running the integration-tests depends on Docker.
