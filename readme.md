# Spring Data JDBC 

The primary goal of the [Spring Data](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data) project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies. This module deals with enhanced support for JDBC based data access layers.

## Features ##

## Getting Help ##

## Quick Start ##

## Execute Tests ##

### Fast running tests

Fast running tests can executed with a simple 

    mvn test

This will execute unit tests and integration tests using an in-memory database.

### Running tests with a real database

To run the integration tests against a specific database you nned to have the database running on your local machine and then execute.

    mvn test -Dspring.profiles.active=<databasetype>

This will also execute the unit tests.

Currently the following *databasetypes* are available:

* hsql (default, does not need to be running)
* mysql

### Run tests with all databases

    mvn test -Pall-dbs

This will execute the unit tests, and all the integration tests with all the databases we currently support for testing. The databases must be running.
